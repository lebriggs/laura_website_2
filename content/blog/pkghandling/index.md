### What's The Point Of This R Script?

If you've ever felt your eyes glaze over at the wall of red text while installing R packages, this script is for you. It automates the installation and loading of R packages, providing clear feedback on whether each package was successfully installed or loaded, or if there were any errors. No more scrolling up to see if everything installed and loaded properly. This script takes the hassle out of package management, letting you focus on the fun stuff— actually analyzing your data!

This post likely seems ridiculously verbose, but without thorough documentation, I won't remember my code choices in two weeks— let's be honest, maybe not even after two days. XD

### Features

- **Automated Installation:** <br>
Automatically checks if required packages are installed and installs them if they are missing.

- **Detailed Feedback:** <br>
Provides clear feedback on the installation and loading status of each package.

- **Error Reporting:** <br>
Captures and reports any errors that occur during installation or loading, making it easier to identify issues quickly.

- **Dependency Management:** <br>
Ensures all necessary dependencies are installed with the required packages.

- **Understandable Code:** <br>
The code contains detailed comments and is simple to understand.

### How It Works

The script works by first checking if each required package is already installed. If a package is missing, it installs the package along with all its dependencies.

#### What Is A Dependency?

In simple terms, a **dependency** is an R package that another package needs to function properly. Think of it like a recipe: if you're baking a traditional cake, you need flour, sugar, and eggs. Similarly, many R packages require other packages (dependencies) to function correctly. This script ensures that all of the required dependencies are installed so that the packages work without any issues.

#### Why Don't We Use The 'require' Function?

At the beginning of the script, we use **install.packages()** instead of **require()** because **require()** only loads a package and doesn't install it if it's missing. By using **install.packages()**, we ensure that any missing package gets installed first before attempting to load it. This approach helps prevent disconcerting errors and helps makes the script more robust.

Here's how the two approaches compare when using the **here** package within a **tryCatch()** block:


``` r
# Using require() within tryCatch

tryCatch({
  if (!require("here", character.only = TRUE)) { #character.only = TRUE is used here to interpret the package name as a string
    install.packages("here", dependencies = TRUE) #install the package with all dependencies
    library(here)
  }
})

# Using install.packages() within tryCatch

tryCatch({
  if (!"here" %in% rownames(installed.packages())) {
    install.packages("here", dependencies = TRUE) #install the package with all dependencies
  }
  library(here)
})
```

- The first script uses **require()** to attempt to load the package, installs it if missing, and then loads it again. **character.only = TRUE** is used to interpret the package name as a string. Using **require()** might initially seem like a solid choice because it is commonly used for loading packages and it returns TRUE if the package is successfully loaded and FALSE if it is not, which can be useful in conditional statements. However, this function does not handle installation if the package is missing, which can lead to errors if not addressed properly.

- The second script directly checks if the **here** package is installed, installs the package with all dependencies if it's missing, and then loads the package. Hence, the risk of the script failing due to missing packages is avoided.

#### Why We Separate The Checking From The Installing Step

We separate the checking from the installing step to prevent errors that occur when a package isn't installed but is attempted to be loaded. By first checking if a package is installed and then installing it if it's not, we ensure a smoother and more reliable process. This approach aligns with our use of **install.packages()** over **require()**, as it avoids confusing error messages and prevents the script from failing due to missing packages.

To further ensure a smooth installation process, we include:

- **Sys.sleep(2)**: <br>
Adds a brief delay to ensure the installation process completes properly before proceeding.

- **.libPaths(.libPaths())**: <br>
Reloads the library paths to ensure that the newly installed package is recognized by the current R session.

After installing the necessary packages and their dependencies, the script attempts to load the package. The script provides feedback at each step, letting you know whether the package was successfully installed and loaded, or if there were any errors.

### Usage Instructions

To use the script, follow these steps:

1. Copy the code into your R environment or R script file. 

2. Run the script to automate the installation and loading of your required packages. 

3. Read the summary to check which packages were installed, loaded successfully, or failed to install/load.

#### Subsequent Sessions

The script also includes a section for loading packages in subsequent R sessions, so you don't have to repeat the installation process.

Here is the line of code in the script:


``` r
#load packages that were previously installed
#pkg2 is the list of required packages that were previously installed

lapply(pkg2, require, character.only = TRUE)
```

#### Why Use The 'require' Function?

Unlike in the previous section ([Why Don't We Use The 'require' Function](#why-dont-we-use-the-require-function)), using **require()** is the correct choice for the susequent packages line of code because:

- **Convenience:** <br>
**require()** returns TRUE if the package is successfully loaded and FALSE otherwise, which can be useful for conditional checks.

- **Quiet Loading:** <br>
Unlike **library()**, which stops execution if the package cannot be loaded, **require()** simply returns FALSE. This can be useful in scripts where you want to handle missing packages more gracefully.

### Example

To illustrate how the script works, let's consider an example with both real and fake packages:

#### Example Packages

The example uses the following list of packages:

- fakepkg: A placeholder for testing error handling
- here
- gt
- gtExtras

#### Expected Output

When you run the script with these example packages, you might see output like this:


``` r
Summary:
failed to install or load package: fakepkg
here was already installed and loaded.
gt was installed and loaded successfully.
gtExtras was installed and loaded successfully.
```

You might also see the following warning message in the console:


``` r
Warning in install.packages :
  package ‘fakepkg’ is not available for this version of R

A version of this package for your version of R might be available elsewhere,
see the ideas at
https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-patched/R-admin.html 
```

#### Explanation Of The Messages

- **failed to install or load package: fakepkg**: <br>
Indicates that **fakepkg** could not be installed or loaded, likely because it does not exist. This placeholder helps test the error handling feature.

- **here was already installed and loaded.**: <br>
Indicates that **here** was found in the installed packages and was loaded successfully.

- **gt was installed and loaded successfully.**: <br>
Indicates that **gt** was not initially installed but was successfully installed and loaded by the script.

- **gtExtras was installed and loaded successfully.**: <br>
Similar to **gt**, **gtExtras** was installed and loaded successfully.

### Embedded Gist 

#### What Is A Gist And Why Use It?

A [Gist](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/creating-gists) is a simple way to share code snippets, notes, or any type of text content. It’s a feature provided by GitHub that allows you to create and share single files or collections of related files.

From my perspective, using a Gist for sharing code offers two primary benefits:

- **Version Control:** <br>
Similar to GitHub repositories, Gists have version control, allowing me to track changes and revert to previous versions if needed.

- **Embedding:** <br>
By embedding a Gist, I can display my code in a readable and interactive format directly within my blog post. If I update the Gist file, the revisions are automatically shown in the blog post where I embedded the script. This means that I only need to maintain the code in one place.

### Show Me The Code

You can access the the script by clicking on the (R SCRIPT) button which is located just below the date at the top of the page. The link will take you to a GitHub Gist page.

Alternatively, here is the embedded Gist for the package handling script:

### Future Improvements

While this script was originally created because I'm a lazy coder who wanted to read less text, the code could be enhanced in a future version. However, adding enhancements will likely introduce complexity into the script, which may make it less beginner-friendly. I would also prefer to keep the script written using base R.

A few potential improvements that I've considered are:

- **Enhanced Logging:** <br>
Add logging to keep a detailed record of all installations and load attempts.

- **User Prompts:** <br>
Include user prompts to confirm installations or to choose specific versions of packages.

- **Parallel Processing:** <br>
Implement parallel processing to speed up the installation of multiple packages. More speed is always better, right? XD

- **Custom Package Repositories:** <br>
Allow users to choose where to download packages from, such as CRAN, Bioconductor, or GitHub.

### Conclusion

Whew! We've finally arrived at the end of this ridiculously long blog post. I appreciate the irony of providing such thorough documentation for a script that I originally wrote because I am a lazy coder.

In summary:

This script automates the tedious process of installing and loading R packages, providing clear feedback, and handling errors gracefully. Try out the code and [let me know](/contact) how it works for you!
