### The Essential Highlights

I first started out in organometallic chemistry because, letâ€™s face it, liquid nitrogen is endlessly cool at any age. 

After earning my MSc. in chemistry, during which I permanently lost the ability to smell skunk odour, I attended library school to obtain my MLIS degree. I then spent several years at various Canadian universities as a science and engineering librarian. 
Later, I transitioned to a role as an information consultant, where I developed big feelings about the orphan drug industry. 

During the COVID-19 pandemic, I returned to school to study data science because I eventually grew weary of singing sea shanty versions of Nickelback songs while in quarantine. My fascination with data science stems from the joy of vigorously shaking a dataset and watching the story fall out.

I'm also actively involved in the workingline German Shepherd Dog (GSD) community, with a lifelong interest in the breed's health data. This interest is reflected in some of the presentations on this website. For example, [this workshop](/talk/dataplan) discusses the advantages of creating a data pre-analysis plan using the health data from a male GSD's offspring (of course, there's a diagram!). I believe that using real datasets, such as the [GSD health data](/dataresource/2024-03-18-nero_dataset/) featured in my presentation, creates opportunities for more authentic learning experiences for students.

This all makes total sense once you meet me.
