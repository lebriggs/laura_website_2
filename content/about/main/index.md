  I've been thinking a lot about how to design prompts for ChatGPT to help with data cleaning in R. One area where this could be especially useful is writing regular expressions â€” a task I really dislike! 
  
  Additionally, I'm considering writing a proposal for an upcoming data librarian conference. I would love to give a workshop on creating interactive maps in R using Leaflet and Shiny to showcase the power of R for data visualization. Deploying a recent map was surprisingly difficult, and I wanted to share a few tricks that I learned along the way.
