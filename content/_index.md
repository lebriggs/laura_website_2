  Hello! I'm Laura. Within my website, you’ll discover my writings about some fun personal projects I’ve worked on. 
  You’ll also find links to presentations I’ve given along with their accompanying materials. 
  In my presentations, I always try to include a reflective element because I think it’s important to discuss the choices I’ve made.
