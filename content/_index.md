description: "I first started out in organometallic chemistry because, let’s face it, liquid nitrogen is endlessly cool at any age. Later, I spent some time in a few Canadian universities as an academic science and engineering librarian. My fascination with data science stems from the joy of vigorously shaking a dataset and watching the story fall out. I'm also actively involved in the workingline German Shepherd Dog (GSD) community, with a lifelong interest in the breed's health data. This focus is reflected in some of the presentations found on this website. I think that using real datasets in student learning creates opportunities for more authentic learning experiences. This all makes total sense once you meet me.


Within my website, you’ll discover my writings about some fun personal projects I’ve worked on. You’ll also find links to presentations I’ve given. In my presentations, I always try to include a reflective element because I think it’s important to discuss the choices I’ve made."
