  I first started out in organometallic chemistry because, let’s face it, liquid nitrogen is endlessly cool at any age. 
  After earning my MSc in chemistry, during which I permanently lost the ability to smell skunk odour, I attended library school to obtain my MLIS degree. 
  I then spent several years at various Canadian universities as a science and engineering librarian. 
  Later, I transitioned to the patent industry, where I developed big feelings about orphan drugs. 
  During the COVID-19 pandemic, I returned to school to study data science because I eventually grew weary of singing sea shanty versions of Nickelback songs during quarantine. 
  My fascination with data science stems from the joy of vigorously shaking a dataset and watching the story fall out. 
  I'm also actively involved in the workingline German Shepherd Dog (GSD) community, with a lifelong interest in the breed's health data. 
  This interest is reflected in some of the presentations on this website. 
  I believe that using real datasets in student learning creates opportunities for more authentic learning experiences. 
  This all makes total sense once you meet me.

  Within my website, you’ll discover my writings about some fun personal projects I’ve worked on. 
  You’ll also find links to presentations I’ve given along with their accompanying materials. 
  In my presentations, I always try to include a reflective element because I think it’s important to discuss the choices I’ve made.
